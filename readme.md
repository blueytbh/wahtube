ChatGPT; For setting up a base script for this code

# yt-dlp

this python script utilizes the yt-dlp module (https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)

# VLC & ffmpeg

this python script requires the holy media player probably made by jesus himself (https://www.videolan.org/vlc/)

and the goofy ass video and audio merger (https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases)
