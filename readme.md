Me; For helping debug, writing readme.md and readmeinstructions.txt, and realizing that i typed 'true' instead of 'True' 80 times in a row (https://github.com/blueytbh)

ChatGPT; For setting up a base script for this code with yt-dlp stuff

# what this script actually does because i forgot to say it at first

basically, this script will download videos from youtube and save it to a directory on your pc (THAT YOU NEED TO EDIT BEFORE USING THE SCRIPT), and once it's done, it'll automatically open the video in VLC (WHICH YOU ALSO NEED TO LIST THE PATH FOR) and yippee you have a youtube video saved to your drive

# yt-dlp

this python script utilizes the yt-dlp module (https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)

# VLC & ffmpeg

this python script requires the holy media player probably made by jesus himself (https://www.videolan.org/vlc/)

and the goofy ass video and audio merger (https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases)
